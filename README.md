# face_age_recognition
Notebook trains on face dataset in order to check if a person is older than 21 for the purpose of buying alcohol.

The folders for the notebook can be found in the accessible google drive folder linked below:

The faces used to train the notebook are in the link but use too much storage for Github to host.
